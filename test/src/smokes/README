This repository contains Hadoop stack stack tests such as smokes, load, etc.

Release Notes:

  at the moment release process is pretty awkward. The following needs to be taken into consideration
 
  1) Preparation needs to have extra arguments passed along:
       % mvn release:prepare -Darguments="-DskipTests -DskipITs"
  2) Because two different projects (with separate pom files) are kept in the same repository you need to run
       % mvn release:perform -Darguments="-DskipTests -DskipITs"
     and after it fails 
       % cd target/checkout
       % mvn deploy -DperformRelease -DskipTests -DskipITs
     At this point release plugin has prepared everything and it can't just find proper pom.xml
  3) Longevity isn't a module of smokes thus a manual changes of
     artifacts versions and amendment of git commits (initially done by
     release pluging in 1) above) is required. This will be fixes soon. (FIXME)
